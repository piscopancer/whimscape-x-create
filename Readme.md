# For artists and developers 🤝

This is a community project, anyone can [contribute](https://github.com/piscopancer/whimscape-x-create/pulls) their assets to this resource pack on the source page. Due to the scale of Create mod and endless number of its addons, it's impossible either for the Whimscape original creator nor for me to adapt Whimscape to cover all content. With combined effort it can be possible though.

## Priorities 📋

1. **Adapting Create**. Either we or Whimscape's creator should give a start to the base Create assets (like copper/zinc items, casings, wooden contraptions) to establish color palette and style for other Create addons to base on.
2. **Adapting Create addons**. You already can make your pull requests to the source adding new assets for Create addons. Just be sure to only cover textures which do not overlap with Create's assets (like copper tank) as base Create has not been adapted yet.
